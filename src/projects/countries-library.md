Project to display data from an API. Generating a small card for every country with some information about it. Created a search and filter functionality: added some logic so that search and filter complement each other. For Example, if the continent "Africa" is selected and you want to search for "Spain", no results will be shown. But if you select "Europe" or "All" then the "Spain" will be shown.
