Project done during an intensive coding bootcamp at Ubiqum Code Academy. Getting data from an API and using it to display a list of cocktails, the recipes and the ingredients used. Also created a list of Spirits and showed all related cocktails.
I also Implemented Firebase to create a google login and a real chat section, to chat with other cocktail lovers.
