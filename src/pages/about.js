        <h1>Some information about me</h1>
        <p>
          My professional career started in tourism. In the different positions
          (hotels, restaurants, airlines, etc) I got the chance to meet many
          different types of people, got to work in different places, had the
          chance to travel the World and faced many, some of them challenging,
          situations. But at some point I realised I had already "taken"
          everything I could, and wanted, from that sector. It was time for a
          CHANGE!

          Then after some investigating, talking with different contacts and
          getting some first hands-on experience in coding, in early 2019 I
          decided to quit my job as a Cabin Crew Member and started looking for
          a coding bootcamp that suited my needs.

          The coding bootcamp at Ubiqum Academy was a great idea! 100% practical
          and based on an agile work environment. I was able to dive completely
          into the coding world. After the bootcamp I found a position where the
          focus was on managing the technical support for the german speaking
          users, structuring their needs and wishes and training and presenting
          the services to new users. It was a great experience as I got the
          chance to learn many new things but I was missing the coding! Then in
          early 2022 I quit that position and started to focus 100% in
          practicing my coding skills. Since then I have worked on various
          projects and websites. Focusing on technologies like HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, React, using Apis, Firebase and GatsbyJS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I am looking for a professional position to strengthen my
          programming skills and continue learning. I am an adventurous person,
          love challenges and I feel ready for this next step in my professional
          path :)
